       "\"Preference shares are a hybrid instrument, blending features of both equity and debt. As\\nthe name suggests, they offer preferential rights over equity shares. Key features include:\\nDividend Priority: Preference shareholders receive dividends before equity\\nshareholders. These dividends are typically at a fixed rate, providing a more\\npredictable income stream compared to the variable dividends of equity shares (Angel\\nOne).\\nLiquidation Priority: In case of company liquidation, preference shareholders have a\\nprior claim on the company's assets over equity shareholders, but after bondholders\\nand other creditors.\\nNo Voting Rights: Generally, preference shareholders do not have voting rights in the\\ncompany, which is a key distinction from equity shareholders. However, they may gain\\nvoting rights if their dividends are in arrears for a specified period (Bajaj Finserv).\\nThere are various types of preference shares, such as cumulative (unpaid dividends\\n\\nsegments, each serving different investment objectives and risk appetites.\\n1.1 Equity Instruments\\nEquity instruments represent ownership in a company. When you buy a share, you\\nbecome a part-owner of the business, entitling you to a portion of its profits and a say in\\nits governance, depending on the type of share.\\nEquity Shares (Common Shares)\\nEquity shares are the most common type of security traded on the BSE. They represent\\nthe primary ownership stake in a corporation. Shareholders are entitled to voting rights on\\nkey corporate matters and receive dividends, which are a portion of the company's profits\\ndistributed to shareholders. However, dividend payments are not guaranteed and depend\\non the company's profitability and board decisions. In the event of liquidation, equity\\nshareholders have the last claim on the company's assets after all debts and other\\nobligations have been settled (Bajaj Finserv).\\nPreference Shares (Preferred Stock)\\n\\nspeculate on or hedge against the overall market movement.\\nStock Futures: Based on individual stocks. They allow for taking a view on a specific\\ncompany's future stock price without owning the shares.\\nOptions\\nAn options contract gives the buyer the right, but not the obligation, to buy (a call option)\\nor sell (a put option) an underlying asset at a specified price (strike price) on or before a\\n\\ncertain date (expiration date). BSE offers:\\nIndex Options: Based on indices like the SENSEX.\\nStock Options: Based on individual stocks. BSE introduced options on 31 stocks in\\nJuly 2001.\\nWeekly Options: A unique product launched by BSE in 2004, offering shorter-term\\ntrading and hedging opportunities (BSE - Basics of Equity Derivatives).\\nWarrants\\nWarrants are similar to options but are generally longer-dated. They give the holder the\\nright to buy a company's stock at a specific price before a set expiration date. They are\\noften issued by companies themselves, sometimes attached to bonds or new stock issues\\nas a sweetener (Investopedia).\\n1.4 Other Traded Instruments\\nExchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)\\nETFs are investment funds that are traded on stock exchanges, much like stocks. They\\nhold a basket of assets such as stocks, bonds, or commodities and typically track a\\nspecific index, like the S&P BSE SENSEX. When you buy an ETF share, you are buying a\""
