The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), established in 1875, is Asia's oldest stock exchange
and a cornerstone of India's financial system. It provides a regulated platform for investors
to buy and sell a wide array of financial instruments, facilitating capital formation for
corporations and wealth creation for investors. As of today, over 6,000 companies are
listed on the BSE, making it one of the largest exchanges globally in terms of listed
entities (HDFC Bank). The trading on BSE is fully electronic, operating on the BOLT (BSE
On-Line Trading) system, and is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Board of India
(SEBI).
The securities traded on the BSE can be broadly categorized into several major
segments, each serving different investment objectives and risk appetites.
1.1 Equity Instruments
Equity instruments represent ownership in a company. When you buy a share, you
become a part-owner of the business, entitling you to a portion of its profits and a say in
its governance, depending on the type of share.
Equity Shares (Common Shares)
Equity shares are the most common type of security traded on the BSE. They represent
the primary ownership stake in a corporation. Shareholders are entitled to voting rights on
key corporate matters and receive dividends, which are a portion of the company's profits
distributed to shareholders. However, dividend payments are not guaranteed and depend
on the company's profitability and board decisions. In the event of liquidation, equity
shareholders have the last claim on the company's assets after all debts and other
obligations have been settled (Bajaj Finserv)
